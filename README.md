## Inspiration

The theme **“impermanence”** inspired the idea that places and people from childhood rarely remain the way we remember them. Familiar environments shift over time, and revisiting them can feel unfamiliar or distorted.

## What It Does

This is a first-person exploration game where you play as a student revisiting his old school.

You explore a 3D-rendered environment built from a 2D grid, interact with characters, and uncover small narrative fragments. As you progress, the same school transitions into darker, altered versions of itself.

The game centers on exploring a familiar place that gradually changes, reflecting how memory and perspective evolve.

## How We Built It

The game runs on a custom engine I built from scratch using **C++** and **SDL2**.

The engine uses 2D raycasting on a grid map to simulate 3D walls through trigonometric calculations.  

Additional details:
- Custom raycasting renderer
- Sprite-based characters and environment assets
- Original soundtrack composed for the game
- Stock and AI-generated character sprites
