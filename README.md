Inspiration
The prompt "impermanence" reminded me of how locations and people you are familiar with growing up, seem to always change and rarely stay how you remembered.

What it does
It’s a first-person exploration game that puts you in the shoes of a student revisiting his old school.

You move through a 3D environment built from a 2D grid, talk to characters, and uncover small story fragments. As you progress, the same school shifts into darker, distorted versions of itself.

The core idea is exploring a familiar place that slowly changes, reflecting how memories and perspectives evolve over time.

How we built it
I built the game from an engine I made from scratch using c++ and SDL2. The engine works by casting 2d rays onto a 2d grid, and simulating 3d walls through trigonometry. I also composed the soundtrack. The sprites were mostly stock images, and some of the sprites for the people were ai generated assets.
